from codebases external to Fulpstation. While the antagonist was originally
developed for Fulpstation, it has been ported and further developed by other
servers at various points in time. Permission has been acquired by assorted
parties to then port these new features back to Fulpstation. Attribution

request which originally introduced the feature, the GitHub pull request which
ported the feature to Fulpstation, and the GitHub user page of the feature's

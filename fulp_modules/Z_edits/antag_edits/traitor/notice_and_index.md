# Notice

Traitor secondary objectives have been removed from our upstream, but we've reimplemented them. This allows us a lot of freedom to develop the feature on our own and adapt it to its fullest potential in Fulp's particular server environment.

This feature reimplementation has been attempted through **MOSTLY MODULAR** means. Still, it is a bit disorganized, so this note serves as an index of every file (modular or otherwise) that lends towards Fulp's reimplementation of traitor secondary objectives.

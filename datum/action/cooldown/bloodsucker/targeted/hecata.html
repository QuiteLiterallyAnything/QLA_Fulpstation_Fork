<p>Focuses more on their vassals than other clans.
Has to rely more on vassals for ranks and blood, as they cannot use the blood altar for leveling up and cannot silent feed.⸸
In exchange, they can raise the dead as temporary vassals to do their bidding, or permanently revive dead existing vassals.
In addition, they can summon Wraiths (shades) around them for both offense and defense
And can send messages to vassals anywhere globally via Dark Communion.
In addition, raising the dead with Necromancy turns them into Sanguine Zombies
They are pseudo zombies, which have high punch damage and special resistances, but aren't infectious nor can they use guns.</p>
<p>⸸ Blood altars are not implemented on Fulpstation, but this comment has been kept regardless.</p></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/QuiteLiterallyAnything/QLA_Fulpstation_Fork/tree/c42a4328d33acce72d4059ae5988ca0a0dcb2110">c42a432</a> (master) — <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
